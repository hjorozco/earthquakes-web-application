                    This website shows information about earthquakes located and registered by the
                    <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/" target="_blank">USGS</a> (United States
                    Geological Survey) and its contributing agencies,

                The USGS registers earthquakes worldwide of magnitude 5.0
                and larger in 30 minutes or less. It may not rapidly register earthquakes smaller
                than 5.0 outside the United States unless they have caused significant damage or are
                widely felt. Earthquakes occurring outside the US and smaller than magnitude 4.5 can
                be difficult for the USGS to register if there are not enough data. The USGS locates
                earthquakes with magnitude 4.0 and larger within the contiguous US and populated
                regions of Alaska within 30 minutes. There are many regional networks around the
                world that can record smaller earthquakes
                in their region than the USGS global network can, and in many cases these regional
                networks do not share their data with the USGS.

                        What is an earthquake?

                    <div class="glossary-paragraph">
                        An earthquake is what happens when two blocks of the earth suddenly slip
                        past one another. The surface where they slip is called the fault or fault
                        plane. The location below the earth’s surface where the earthquake starts is
                        called the hypocenter, and the location directly above it on the surface of
                        the earth is called the epicenter.
                    </div>
                    <div class="glossary-paragraph">Sometimes an earthquake has foreshocks. These are
                        smaller earthquakes that happen in the same place as the larger earthquake
                        that follows. Scientists can’t tell that an earthquake is a foreshock until
                        the larger earthquake happens. The largest, main earthquake is called the
                        mainshock. Mainshocks always have aftershocks that follow. These are smaller
                        earthquakes that occur afterwards in the same place as the mainshock.
                        Depending on the size of the mainshock, aftershocks can continue for weeks,
                        months, and even years after the mainshock!

                    <div class="glossary-paragraph">
                        The earth has four major layers: the inner core, outer core, mantle and
                        crust. The crust and the top of the mantle make up a thin skin on the
                        surface of our planet.
                    </div>
                    <div class="glossary-paragraph">
                        But this skin is not all in one piece – it is made up of many pieces like a
                        puzzle covering the surface of the earth. Not only that, but these puzzle
                        pieces keep slowly moving around, sliding past one another and bumping into
                        each other. We call these puzzle pieces tectonic plates, and the edges of
                        the plates are called the plate boundaries. The plate boundaries are made up
                        of many faults, and most of the earthquakes around the world occur on these
                        faults. Since the edges of the plates are rough, they get stuck while the
                        rest of the plate keeps moving. Finally, when the plate has moved far
                        enough, the edges unstick on one of the faults and there is an earthquake.
