***About the website.***

***About the code.***
 - The data displayed comes from the [USGS Earthquake Catalog API](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/), an implementation of the [FDSN Event Web Service Specification](http://www.fdsn.org/webservices/FDSN-WS-Specifications-1.0.pdf), which allows custom searches for earthquake information using a variety of parameters.
 - The maps are displayed using [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/), an open-source JavaScript library  
for creating interactive maps. 
 - Leaflet uses data from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) which provides free open map data.
 - The *Contact* form uses [SmtpJS.com](https://smtpjs.com/), a license free script written in JavaScript that uses the SMTP protocol to send emails.
